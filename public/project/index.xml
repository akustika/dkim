      <title>Individual differences in plasticity in speech perception</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although speech sounds are highly variable and listeners may have limited cognitive resources under adverse conditions, listeners are shown to overcome these challenges by flexibly adapting to varying contextual demands and achieve perceptual constancy. As such, understanding how listeners cope with adverse conditions is a fundamental issue for better understanding the perceptual processes and cognitive mechanisms underlying speech perception. Most studies of perceptual adaptation in speech have thus far typically reported on group level observations, which may mask considerable differences in how individual listeners adapt. This project addresses these issues by examining the mechanisms underlying adaptive plasticity in speech perception using an individual differences approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to better understand the linguistic and cognitive mechanisms underlying adaptive plasticity in speech perception. We examine how individuals overcome adverse listening conditions and what makes some individuals better adapters to variability in the speech signal and cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A longitudinal study of the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that second language (L2) learners have difficulties in acquiring speech sound contrasts not present in their native language. Some documented difficulties include the English /l/-/ɹ/ contrast for Japanese learners and the English /i/-/ɪ/ contrast for Spanish and Korean learners. This may be related to the observation that native listeners categorize speech sounds using multiple acoustic cues but that, for any given contrast, they pay more attention to certain cues over others; this is referred to as perceptual cue weighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most studies of L2 acquisition of sound categories have focused either on comparing the learning of different contrasts or on the learning of appropriate cue weights for particular contrasts. Most studies have also used cross-sectional approaches to investigate the development of L2 speech acquisition. Moreover, relatively little has been reported on age-related differences in L2 speech acquisition. Taken together, this has limited our understanding of (1) how individuals’ cue weighting strategies change over time, (2) how cue weights are acquired across contrasts, (3) how developmental changes in perception are related to those in production within individual learners, (4) how L2 speech acquisition influences L1 categories over time, and (5) whether adult and child learners show different developmental patterns. The goal of this project is to address these issues using longitudinal data to better understand how individual second language learners differ in their developmental trajectories in the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts over time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The relationship between speech perception and production</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As language users who perceive and produce speech sounds, the link between speech perception and production is inherent in our use of spoken language. Although narrowing down the link is a harder task, understanding the nature of the link is important for better understanding the mechanisms underlying speech perception and production as well as for the better understanding of speech communication in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to better understand how speech perception and production is linked at an individual level. This study investigates this relation using phonetic imitation. We use manipulated natural vowel stimuli varying in spectral quality and duration in both perception and production tasks to explore the perception-production link in a direct and controlled way. We examine (1) whether individual listeners’ perceptual cue weights are related to their patterns of phonetic imitation and (2) the underlying mechanisms of phonetic imitation.&lt;/p&gt;
