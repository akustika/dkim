Some documented diﬀiculties include the English /l/-/ɹ/ contrast for Japanese learners and the English /i/-/ɪ/ contrast for Spanish and Korean learners. This may be related to the observation that native listeners categorize speech sounds using multiple acoustic cues but that, for any given contrast, they pay more attention to certain cues over others; this is referred to as perceptual cue weighting. \n\nMost studies of L2 acquisition of sound categories have focused either on comparing the learning of different contrasts or on the learning of appropriate cue weights for particular contrasts. Most studies have also used cross-sectional approaches to investigate the development of L2 speech acquisition. Moreover, relatively little has been reported on age-related differences in L2 speech acquisition. Taken together, this has limited our understanding of (1) how individuals’ cue weighting strategies change over time, (2) how cue weights are acquired across contrasts, especially between easier and harder contrasts that rely on the same acoustic cues such as /i/-/ɪ/ and /ɛ/-/æ/, and (3) whether adult and child learners show different developmental patterns.\n\nThe goal of this project is to understand how individual second language learners differ in their developmental trajectories in the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts. We take an individual differences approach using longitudinal data to investigate how individual L2 learners differ in their developmental trajectories over time. We also test whether child and adult learners differ in their acquisition patterns and whether they follow different trajectories.\n",
