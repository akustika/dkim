Broadly, I am interested in speech perception and production, phonetics, second language acquisition and psycholinguistics. My research focuses on second-language speech learning, linguistic and cognitive mechanisms in speech perception and production, and adaptive processes in speech perception. I am particularly interested in how these processes differ across individuals and how they are integrated to broaden our understanding of cognitive mechanisms in speech processing and language learning. \n\nCurrently, I am working on my PhD dissertation on how listeners overcome challenging listening conditions and what makes listeners better adapt to variability in both the signal and listening environments.\n\nPreviously, I investigated how individual second language learners differ in their developmental trajectories in the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts. I also examined how and to what extent speech perception and production are linked at an individual level using phonetic imitation.\n",
