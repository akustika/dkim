Understanding how listeners overcome these adverse conditions is a fundamental issue for better understanding the mechanisms underlying perceptual learning in speech and more generally speech perception processes. \n\nThe goal of this project is to better understand the underlying mechanisms of perceptual adaptation to variability of speech. We examine how listeners overcome challenging conditions and what makes listeners better adapt to variability in both the signal and listening environments.\n",
