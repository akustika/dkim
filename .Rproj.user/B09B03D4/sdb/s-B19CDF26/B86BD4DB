We used manipulated stimuli with the goal of more directly probing the link and to test (1) whether individual listenersâ€™ perceptual cue weights are related to their patterns of phonetic imitation and (2) the underlying mechanisms of phonetic imitation. Twenty-three native speakers of English completed a 2AFC identification task followed by a baseline production and a forced imitation task. Perception stimuli were created from productions of head and had recorded by a native speaker of English. Seven steps varying in formant frequency (created with TANDEM-STRAIGHT) were crossed with 7 duration steps (PSOLA in Praat). Imitation stimuli were a subset of stimuli from the perception task plus extended and shortened vowel durations. Our results suggest that phonetic imitation is mediated in part by a low-level cognitive process involving a direct link between perception and production as evidenced by imitation of all vowel durations. However, this study also suggests that imitation is mediated by a high-level linguistic component, i.e., phonological contrasts, which is a selective rather than an automatic process as indicated by imitation of phonologically relevant formant frequencies.\"\n\nabstract_short = \"\"\n\nevent = \"5th Joint Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America and the Acoustical Society of Japan\"\n\nevent_url = \"http://acousticalsociety.org/content/5th-joint-meeting-acoustical-society-america-and-acoustical-society-japan\"\nlocation = \"Honolulu, USA\"\n\nselected = false\nmath = true\nurl_pdf = \"\"\nurl_slides = \"\"\nurl_video = \"\"\n\n[[url_custom]]\nname = \"Poster\"\nurl = \"http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/pdfs/Kim_ASA_2016.pdf\"\n\n# # Optional featured image (relative to `static/img/` folder).\n# [header]\n# image = \"headers/bubbles-wide.jpg\"\n# caption = \"My caption :smile:\"\n\n+++\n",
