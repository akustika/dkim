abstract = "This study investigates the relationship between speech perception and production using a phonetic imitation paradigm. We used manipulated stimuli in both perception and production tasks to explore the perception-production link in a more direct and controlled way. Here we examined (1) whether individual listeners’ perceptual cue weights are related to their patterns of phonetic imitation and (2) the underlying mechanisms of phonetic imitation. Results showed that individuals’ perceptual cue weights are tightly linked to their production patterns in imitation. Specifically, better perceptual abilities (i.e., greater cue weights) were converted into better imitation of vowel duration. Furthermore, imitation of ambiguous vowels was mediated by contrast maintenance, but perceptually salient extended and shortened vowels facilitated more imitation regardless of their phonological relevance. These results suggest that speech perception and production are indeed linked but not in an obvious way, and both linguistic and cognitive factors play a role in this process."

abstract_short = "In speech communication, language users constantly change roles and thus a language user who was once a speaker is subsequently a listener and vice versa, mutually influencing each other’s utterances. In terms of cognitive mechanisms of these processes, interlocutors interactively align their representations used in production and comprehension. This shows that the link between speech perception and production is inherent in our use of spoken language. Furthermore, understanding the nature of the relationship as to how and to what extent representations are shared or separate between perception and production may shed light on speech communication more generally. However, narrowing down the nature of the link is a harder task. In the present study, we focus on the nature of the link at the level of an individual language user."
