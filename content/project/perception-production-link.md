The goal of this project is to better understand how speech perception and production is linked at an individual level. This study investigates the relation between speech perception and production using a phonetic imitation paradigm. We used manipulated stimuli in both perception and production tasks with the goal of more directly exploring the link between the two, and examined (1) whether individual listenersâ€™ perceptual cue weights are related to their patterns of phonetic imitation and (2) the underlying mechanisms of phonetic imitation.
