Although speech sounds are highly variable and listeners may have limited cognitive resources under adverse conditions, listeners are shown to overcome these challenges by flexibly adapting to these varying situations and achieving an invariant percept. Understanding how listeners overcome these adverse conditions is a fundamental issue for better understanding the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms underlying speech perception. Most studies of perceptual adaptation in speech have thus far typically reported on group level observations, which may mask considerable differences in how individual listeners adapt. This project addresses these issues by examining the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms underlying perceptual adaptation in speech using an individual differences approach.

The goal of this project is to to shed light on the linguistic and cognitive mechanisms underlying adaptive plasticity in speech perception. We examine how listeners overcome challenging conditions and what makes some listeners better adapter to variability in both the speech signal and listening environments.
