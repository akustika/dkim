Although speech sounds are highly variable and listeners may have limited cognitive resources under adverse conditions, listeners are shown to overcome these challenges by flexibly adapting to these varying situations and achieving an invariant percept. Understanding how listeners overcome these adverse conditions is a fundamental issue for better understanding the mechanisms underlying perceptual learning in speech and more generally speech perception processes. 

The goal of this project is to better understand the underlying mechanisms of perceptual adaptation to variability of speech. We examine how listeners overcome challenging conditions and what makes listeners better adapt to variability in both the signal and listening environments.
