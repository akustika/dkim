title = "The role of cognitive abilities in speech perception under cognitive load: An individual differences approach"

abstract = "This study examines how and to what extent speech perception abilities are modulated by increased cognitive load and whether individuals differ in the extent to which they adjust their cue weighting strategies in the utilization of multiple acoustic cues under cognitive load. This study also investigates whether individuals' cue weighting strategies are related to their cognitive abilities under cognitive load. Native English listeners (N=54) were engaged in a dual task in which they completed a two-alternative forced choice identification task with concurrent visual search. Participants also completed cognitive tasks examining working memory and inhibitory control. Results revealed that listeners' cue weights were overall modulated under cognitive load, but there were large individual differences in this process and these differences were associated with individuals' cognitive abilities. That is, individuals with better working memory and inhibitory control showed more increases in cue weights than those with poorer working memory and inhibitory control."
