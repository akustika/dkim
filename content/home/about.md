# Welcome
I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [University of Exeter](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk). I am part of a research team with [Nicolas Dumay](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Nicolas_Dumay) and [Arthur Samuel](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/psychology/faculty/faculty_profiles/asamuel), working on the role of sleep in language learning and memory consolidation. We are particularly interested in the nature of lexical representations and the time course of word learning. Prior to joining the current research team, I completed my PhD in Linguistics with [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). My PhD research focused on plasticity in speech learning in native and second-language speakers. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in phonetics, laboratory phonology, speech perception and production, psycholinguistics, and second language acquisition. My research focuses on understanding the linguistic representations and cognitive processes involved in speech perception and production, second-language speech learning, and word recognition and learning. I am particularly concerned with how these processes differ across individuals and how they can inform language learning and processing.
