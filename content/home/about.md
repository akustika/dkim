# Welcome

I am an assistant professor in the Department of English Language and Literature at [Kyungpook National University](https://www.knu.ac.kr/wbbs/wbbs/main/main.action). I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the [University of Exeter](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk) as part of a research team with [Nicolas Dumay](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Nicolas_Dumay) and [Arthur Samuel](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/psychology/faculty/faculty_profiles/asamuel), after completing my PhD in Linguistics with [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in psycholinguistics, speech perception, phonetics, applied linguistics, and second language acquisition. My research focuses on understanding the linguistic representations and cognitive processes involved in speech perception and production, second language speech, and word recognition and learning. I am particularly concerned with how these processes differ across individuals and how they can inform language learning and processing.
