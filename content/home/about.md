# Biography

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Exeter. Here, I am part of a research team with Dr. Nicolas Dumay and Dr. Arthur Samuel, working on the role of sleep in learning and memory. We are particularly interested in sleep-mediated memory consolidation in word learning. Broadly, I am interested in speech perception and production, psycholinguistics, phonetics, and second language acquisition. My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying linguistic and cognitive processes involved in speech perception and production, second-language speech learning, and word learning. I am particularly concerned with how these processes differ across individuals and how they can inform language learning and processing.

I completed my PhD in Linguistics with Dr. Meghan Clayards at McGill University. In my dissertation, I examined how listeners overcome challenging listening conditions (e.g., foreign-accented speech, cognitive load) and what makes some listeners better adapters to variability in the speech signal and cognitive load. In addition to my dissertation research, I conducted a longitudinal study on how individual second language learners differ in their developmental trajectories in the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts. I also investigated the nature of the relationship between speech perception and production within an individual using phonetic imitation.
