# Biography
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk). I am part of a research team with [Nicolas Dumay](http://psychology.exeter.ac.uk/staff/index.php?web_id=Nicolas_Dumay) and [Arthur Samuel](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/psychology/faculty/faculty_profiles/asamuel), working on the role of sleep in language learning and memory consolidation. We are particularly interested in sleep-associated memory consolidation in spoken word recognition and word learning. Broadly speaking, I am interested in speech perception and production, phonetics, laboratory phonology, psycholinguistics, and second language acquisition. My research focuses on understanding the linguistic representations and cognitive processes involved in speech perception and production, second-language speech learning, and word recognition and learning. I am particularly concerned with how these processes differ across individuals and how they can inform language learning and processing.

I completed my PhD in Linguistics with [Meghan Clayards](http://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca). In my dissertation, I examined how listeners overcome challenging listening conditions (e.g. foreign-accented speech and dual-tasking) and what makes some listeners better adapters to variability in the speech signal and cognitive load. In addition to my dissertation research, I conducted a longitudinal study on how individual second language learners differ in their developmental trajectories in the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts. I also investigated the nature of the relationship between speech perception and production within an individual using phonetic imitation.
