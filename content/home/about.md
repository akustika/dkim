# Biography

I am a PhD candidate of linguistics at McGill University. Broadly, I am interested in speech perception and production, psycholinguistics, phonetics, and second language acquisition. My research focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying linguistic and cognitive processes in speech perception and production, second-language speech learning, and adaptive plasticity in spoken language. I am particularly concerned with how these processes differ across individuals and how they can inform language learning and processing.

My doctoral dissertation examines how listeners overcome challenging listening conditions (e.g., foreign-accented speech, cognitive load) and what makes some listeners better adapters to variability in the speech signal and cognitive load. The overarching goal of my dissertation is to shed light on the linguistic and cognitive mechanisms underlying adaptive plasticity in speech perception.

In addition to my dissertation research, I conducted longitudinal research on how individual second language learners differ in their developmental trajectories in the acquisition of novel speech sound contrasts. I also investigated the nature of the relationship between speech perception and production within individuals using phonetic imitation.
